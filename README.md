# Using Git and GitHub

## Why?
Hi! If this you're first time using Git and GitHub, don't worry the essential parts are not that hard.
The reason we're using these tools is so we can collaborate and work on multi-file projects without too much of a hassle.
(Sending multiple files of code back and forth in Messenger is not an option!)

Git is a distributed version control system for computer files. Think of it as a save system from a video game! 
While GitHub is a platform for Git where you can store your code.

## How?
Look up on how to install Git on your computer and create a GitHub account. Use your personal email, you can link your school email for perks!.

### CLI (Command Line Interface)
The CLI is a powerful tool when using Git, although you can use GitHub Desktop, the CLI allows you to have more control and specification.
