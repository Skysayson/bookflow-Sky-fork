# Using Git and GitHub

## Why?
Hi! If this you're first time using Git and GitHub, don't worry the essential parts are not that hard.
The reason we're using these tools is so we can collaborate and work on multi-file projects without too much of a hassle.
(Sending multiple files of code back and forth in Messenger is not an option!)

Git is a distributed version control system for computer files. Think of it as a save system from a video game! 
While GitHub is a platform for Git where you can store your code.

## How?
Look up on how to install Git on your computer and create a GitHub account. Use your personal email, you can link your school email for perks!.

### CLI (Command Line Interface)
The CLI is a powerful tool when using Git, although you can use GitHub Desktop, the CLI allows you to have more control and specification.

## Getting started 
First, go into the directory of your project/folder that you want to work with. In MacOS, you will utilize Terminal which already uses a Unix shell, for Windows you will need to install Git Bash, and navigate using shell commands such as:

* mkdir (make directory)
  - Creates a new folder

* cd (change directory)
  - Moves the console into the respective directory.

That's all the bash commands for now.

Assuming that you have installed Git and created a GitHub account. Let's begin!

Use ```cd``` to move into your working directory (the directory or folder that you will work on). Then use ```git init``` to initialize an empty Git repository. You will only do ```git init``` once for a project.
